The code which produces the histograms useful for commissioning is in:
CommPlotProducer.C  
CommPlotProducer.h  

 -> add any new variable in the .h file (if it crashes, check the lenght of the vectors)
 -> check the trigger list in .C  : in the passTrigger2016, passTrigger2017 function --> missing passTrigger2018 for the moment
 -> check the eta Limit : EtaCut in the Loop function
 -> check the muon selection in the .C : in the passPFMuonSelection function
 -> check the WP in the .C : in the Loop function
 -> check the cross-sections in the .C : in the SetXS function
 -> modify the link in the .h to PhysicsTools/Utilities/interface/LumiReweightingStandAlone.h (needed for the PU reweighting)

To run this code, use:
runCode.C
which calls one of the following executable codes (2 examples to cover different possibilities):
exeCode.C
exeCode2
 
To display the histograms, use:
DrawCommPlot.C
as in 
runPlotdata.C
runPlotmc.C
runPlotComm_jetht.C


The roc curves can be produced with 
DrawEfficiencyPlot.C 

note: tdrstyle.C is needed in DrawCommPlot.C and in DrawEfficiencyPlot.C
